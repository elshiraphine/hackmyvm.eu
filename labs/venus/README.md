 ## HMVLabs - Venus

Venus is a beginner challenge to start learning linux and basic scripting. Based on it's challenge page, it's say that *"This is a beginner level so enjoy and be patient!"*.

So, let's start the challenge!!

### Connect to this Machine

Using SSH Connection to connect using this command:
```sh
ssh hacker@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```
and input the password. The password was available on it's official website on this [link](https://hackmyvm.eu/venus/index.php).

### 001 - Venus

To start hacking, let's read the readme.txt on the machine first :D <br />

![image](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/e91ad7f3-a3f2-431f-97d3-d7fca20dc6c2)


After read the image, we know that we should open the mission.txt to know what mission we should solve. Let's open the file instead :D <br />
![venus-mission](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/25a31508-d312-4e5b-91b6-e925acca4dbb)


Okay, because the mission said that there is a hidden file in this folder. Let's take a look using `ls -lah` command. Then we found a file that named `.myhiddenpazz`. Open it and use to connect with user sophia using `su sophia` and insert the password that we found at previouz `.myhiddenpazz` file.

Go to home directory of user sophia and cat the flagz.txt. <br />

![sophia-flagz](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/8c161d75-a536-40ba-855f-b526fd8b9ff8)

### 002 - Sophia

Let's move to the sophia challenge and take a look of it's mission. <br />

The mission said that user angela does not remember where she place the `whereismypazz.txt`. So let's find the specific file using this command:
```sh
find / -name "whereismypazz.txt" -print 2>/dev/null
```

The find command will find `whereismypazz.txt` file on `/` path, and will redirect the error message to `/dev/null`. Gotcha! The file was found in `/usr/share/whereismypazz.txt`. Let's open that file and use it to connect with user angela then go to home directory of user angela and cat the flagz.txt. <br />

### 003 - Angela

Yo! We made it here and let's open the next mission! <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 030151](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/869e4c82-07c6-4d92-99f5-4a038df85226)


The mission said that user emma is in line 4069 of file `findme.txt`. It's easy because we can find the specific line using awk
```
awk 'NR==4069' findme.txt
```

Let's try to connect with user emma using that password and gotcha we successfully connected to user emma :D. Then, go to home directory and cat the flag! <br />

### 004 - Emma

Open the mission and it will say that user mia has left her password in - files. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 032246](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/e7e6ec90-6714-4c2c-882f-bbbb66071e83)


This is a little bit tricky because it requires some attentions to work with dashed filename in unix/linux because dash (-) is generally used by commands to specify options and arguments.

So let's cat the file using the dot (current directory)
```
cat ./-
```

Then we found mia's password. Let's connect to user mia with that password and cat the flagz.txt. <br />
![Screenshot 2023-08-01 032742](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/b18d283f-e6d1-41cd-9f97-192261f11b45)


### 005 - Mia

Open the mission and based on the mission, we should find camila's password in folder `hereiam`. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 033131](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/925c920a-67a2-4923-8b5c-720cc29ae678)

Let's use the same approach as [sophia's](#002---sophia) approach but we need to add flag `-type d` because we need to find a directory.
```sh
find / -type d -name "hereiam" 2>/dev/null
```

Consequently, the directory can be located at `/opt/hereiam`. Let's list all the file of the directory and cat the `.here` file.

Yey, we found the camila's password! So, let's connect and get the flag :D <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 034215](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/ae0bed68-3fe1-4410-9aab-e4422cd8a2a8)


### 006 - Camila

Based on the mission, user luna just left her password inside the muack folder. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 043913](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/3d3298bc-1208-4dec-a09d-c5878de20e75)

Let's take a look the folder. <br />
![Screenshot 2023-08-01 034959](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/804c10a4-dfd9-4c16-80c6-7f14eaf825dd)


Muack folder have so many directory and subdirectory and searching for them individually would become exceedingly exhausting, so let's just using find command with `type -f` flag that indicate we want to search a file instead of directory.
```
find . -type f
```

Yay, the file was found in `./111/111/muack` and let's just cat the file and use the password to connect to user luna. Then, go cat the flagz.txt :D <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 035415](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/d343a972-7a5f-4910-ba2c-126ce7dc67ba)


### 007 - Luna

The mission said that user eleanor has left her password in a file that occupies 6969 bytes. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 035638](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/bf80bdff-50c9-4416-8808-d503a917a601)

Let's find the 6969 bytes file using `-size` flag
```sh
find / -size 6969c 2>/dev/null
```

That's mean we want to find the file that have 6969 bytes (character) in directory `/`. The file was found in `/usr/share/moon.txt`. Let's cat the text, connect to the user eleanor and get the flag. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 040205](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/ee2c0700-d299-46d2-849d-d8f922d69d9a)


### 008 - Eleanor

Yey you made to this! Let's open the mission and it said that user victoria has left her password in a file in which the owner is the user violin. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 040511](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/3f4c245d-6343-433a-8c22-c0cba4b9ca84)

So let's find the file by its owner using `-user` flag
```sh
find / -user violin -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Gotcha, the file was found in `/usr/local/games/yo`. Let's go to the directory.

Open the `yo` file and connect to user victoria then get the flaggggg XD <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 041032](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/76522439-32a7-46e1-a454-722511dada17)

### 009 - Victoria

We made to #09 mission. Based on the mission, user isla has left her password in a zip file. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 041218](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/3c02b054-985f-49bb-b73e-abb62b400bd6)

Okay let's try to unzip the zip file. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 041349](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/c7e4174b-2fbb-4d24-9b41-f50736fe8dce)

It's said that we cannot create a folder because permission is denied. So, because at first mission we can use /tmp folder to write a file, let's just unzip it to `/tmp` folder.
```sh
unzip passw0rd.zip -d /tmp
```

Then, let's just cat the output `/tmp/pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt` and use the password to connect to user isla and get the flag. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 042007](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/f7ae701c-bf39-48e4-9e3d-e0bf19f58cb7)


### 010 - Isla

The mission said that The password of the user violet is in the line that begins with a9HFX. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 043913](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/a7b79725-3b29-43c2-aa0c-c86daab63bf3)

Let's just cat the `passy` file and pip it with grep the `a9HFX` strings and use `^` symbols to indicate that we want the `a9HFX` is the beginning of the string.

```
cat passy | grep '^a9HFX' | awk '{print substr($1,6); }'
```

But, because the `a9HFX` string is not the part of the password, so let's just the print the substring started with index 6 using awk.

Gotcha, we found the password to connect to the user violet and get the flag. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 044947](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/9a9b231f-4005-4e2d-b7f4-b843df8e54ea)

### 011 - Violet

Let's move to mission #11, the mission said that the password of the user lucy is in the line that ends with 0JuAZ (these last 5 characters are not part of her password).<br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 043913](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/ac2e24b8-4e1d-43eb-b18a-96316f5dac5f)


So, let's just grep the string that have a `0JuAZ` substring. Using the same approach as previous mission, let's remove the last 5 characters using substr method in awk.

```sh
cat end | grep 0JuAZ | awk '{print substr($1, 1, length($1)-5); }'
```

Then, use the password to login with user lucy and cat the flag. <br />

![Screenshot 2023-08-01 044947](https://github.com/elshiraphine/hackmyvm.eu/assets/89353307/4a16b970-cfef-4ee1-96eb-470e647bcd75)


### 012 - Lucy

The mission in user lucy said that the password of the user elena is between the characters fu and ck.

So let's grep the string and pipe the command with awk.

```sh
cat file.yo | grep -o 'fu.*ck' | awk 'BEGIN{FS="fu|ck"} {gsub(/^.*fu|ck.*$/,""); print}'
```

Let's use the strings as the password of user elena and then get the flag.
